"""InterviewCoach tools server.

Handles three tools called by the AssemblyAI voice agent:
  - get_question    → returns the next interview question for a role
  - evaluate_answer → scores an answer with local heuristics
  - get_session_summary → returns a final session report

Powered entirely by the AssemblyAI Voice Agent API — no OpenAI key needed.
The managed LLM inside AssemblyAI handles all dialogue and coaching feedback.
This server only does the structured scoring math (word count, fillers, STAR).

Runs on port 8002. The browser forwards client-side tool.call events here.

Usage:
    python backend/interview_tools_server.py   (from the workspace root)
